## Overview üåê

WebCrawl Wizard is a Python project designed to scrape data from websites, store it in a database (`mysql`),
and generate reports based on the collected information. It allows indexing all the links from a given site across
multiple specified levels of crawling. This project serves as a hands-on experience for diving into more advanced
web scraping techniques in Python.

Future enhancements are planned to refine
its capabilities further. Please refer to the "Future Improvements" section for details on the
upcoming enhancements and features.
